;=====================================================
; Thank You For Downloading The Metro Transit (8) Line
;=====================================================

This was the first route I made for BVE when I learned how to do so. I never released it and have decided to update it.
This is it.

This download contains 2 route files. A Early Morning Rush Hour Express, and a Late Night Local.
The route files are optomized to perform with the NYCTA R142 Subway Car. (This is a fictional route!!)

Keys:

1) The Express file makes 14 Stops. Most platforms are 175 meters. Some are 200. Make sure you apply
   brakes at the appropriate time.

2) The Local file makes 21 Stops. Again, most platforms are 175 meters. Some are 200. Make sure you apply
   brakes at the appropriate time.

3) Follow all speed markers. (There are not many of them. You can pretty much open it up!!!)

4) The 8 line runs from Franklin Street, Brooklyn to Highbridge, Brooklyn. All station names are real streets
   in the borough of Brooklyn.

5) The 8 line began service on March 27th, 1962 to provide service to Northern Brooklyn. It makes it's connection
   with the 7 Local at Flushing Avenue, and is a supplemental line. It has heavy ridership.
