SOME A STOCK HANDLING TECHNIQUES & HINTS
----------------------------------------

The A stock takes a bit of skill to drive correctly, one reason for this is due to the train 
having 'two handles', one for traction control and another for brake.

When you 'open the train up'on a real A stock, you insert your control Key and then open the 
DBVIC (Drivers Brake Valve Isolating Cock), then you have to cancel the 'Audible Warning'. 
On this version of the train, this is simulated to some extent. Due to the limits of BVE, 
it has been set up so that when you select 'FWD' the audible warning kicks in, to reset it, 
please press SPACE once you have pressed this key, the noise of air escaping will
cease.

Please also note that the train has no Door to Brake to Door interlock, meaning that you can get a full
a full brake release with the doors open, however you cannot apply any traction.
