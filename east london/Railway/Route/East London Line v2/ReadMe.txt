THIS TRAIN AND THE EAST LONDON LINE ROUTE UPDATE FOR BVE 4 IS DEDICATED TO THOSE WHOSE LIVES WERE LOST IN THE LONDON TRANSPORT BOMBINGS ON THE MORNING OF THURSDAY 7TH JULY 2005. ALSO TO THE EMERGENCY SERVICE AND LONDON UNDERGROUND STAFF WHO BRAVELY TOOK PART IN THE EVACUATION AND RESCUE OPERATION.


Welcome to version 2 of the East London Line. The route has now been updated:

- converted from .rw to .csv
- BVE 4 compatible files added
- Extra route files added for a night route, also an off-peak Whitechapel starter
- Realistic gradients
- Realistic 'Northern Line v3' signalling
- Some of the BVE4 routes have rain


This BVE route is the East London Line Shoreditch to New Cross Gate southbound route.  This readme details the particulars
of this route, and things you need to know beforehand (well don't *need* per se, but you might find 
useful...).


Accuracy
--------

This route has been created using very little resources. There is no cab ride video available, and I do
not have the time, money, or resources to go making my own with a camcorder (I don't own one for a
start). As such, the only resources I have are pictures I've taken myself, pictures other people have 
taken and sent me, my own memory, information from other peopple, and aerial photos I scoured from 
streetmap.co.uk. The result of this is that accuracy is going to be at its highest in stations, and even 
then not guaranteed. The following should be noted with respect to that:

Shoreditch station: 	This is not easy to get to (except in peak hours), and there's a lot of  
			surrounding scenery. Not all it is perfect, not even drawn.

Whitechapel station:	Surface buildings are too complex. You'll have to settle for a plain wall.

Northern cuttings:	Little scenery on the surface. Not much can be seen, and there's not much to see
			anyways.

Canada Water station:	A lot is missing, but a lot is present. I felt nervous taking pictures there as
			on both occasions I was reminded that flash photography was not permitted (they 
			watch you.. they do..). I don't think anything significant is missing. Note: 
			there is a *minor* bug there where part of the station platform disappears as you
			pass it. This is only noticable for about 2 seconds if you pass very slowly.

Surrey Quays station:	A lot of scenery has been omitted, or simplified, on the surface level. The left 
			side of the southbound platform has been simplified. No benches are present, nor
			is there any decorative work on the northbound side.

New Cross Gate station:	Platform five cunningly concealed by a Connex Train. There's no scenery behind it.
			Trust me. Certain things are missing, but they are not significant. Styling is not
			too accurate either.

Wapping station:	Thames tunnel end not too detailed. Nothing important missing, aside from the 
			monitors.

Shadwell:		No steps from the platform ends down to the tracks at the southern end.

Southern cuttings:	Simplifed surface scenery.

Silwood junction:	Simplified scenery. Left bank down to rail bridge simplified.

Open air section:	Simplified scnery, some objects improvised.

Power rails:		Arranged logically, with gaps in places. No rail fouling at points/crossings.
			No relation to actual layout.

Curves/Gradients:	Updated Feb 2005 - Accurate gradients

Shadwell to Wapping:	Seperate wall is best guess. Based on observations, but may not look anything like
			it should.

Thames Tunnel:		Arches are too short on the right, but to make them higher would have involved even
			more complex vertex calculation, to place two arches together. Colour is off due to 
			light-level averaging (it would look brighter where the train lights shine on it).


Stop points
-----------

The option to show a marker at the stop point is turned off at all stations. This means you need to know
where to stop. For most of the time, just in front of the staff access gate will do. The exceptions are:

Shoreditch: 		You start here. :P
Whitechapel:		Gate is slightly forward, still stop just in front of it.
Surrey Quays:		Barriers slightly further back. Aim to stop with just the cab door ahead of the barrier.
New Cross Gate:		No LU staff access gate. Stop point is just in front of the red stop lights, where the
			rails turn to a rusty colour. *Try* and stop here :)

Use of Objects
--------------

Most objects in this route are (C) 2002 Richard Gellman, and are originals. If you wish to use them, please ask first.
Particularly as some of them are *not* mine, and I may need to refer you to the original author.

Specifically:
houserow.bmp is (C) Paul Jobber
The outside signal objects - Steve Green.
The blue "carriage counter" objects are (C) Steve Green
stone.bmp (and derivatives) (although modified) was originally by Robert Glass.
The train departure sounds are (C) Robert Glass
t1.bmp, and tree.b3d are (C) Steve Green
The A-stock train object is (C) Paul Jobber
The Connex CIG train object is (C) Steve Green 
The platform objects are derived from originals by Robert Glass
All rail objects, points, and crossings were made using Switch by Ruede Hullsmann (i think thats how its spelled)
The red lights at New Cross Gate (and also in the signal at wapping) are from the UK signal bmps. I forget who made them...
The rail safety bitmaps are (C) Anthony Bowden
The speed limit bitmaps are (C) Steve Green


And that's it.. I think...

Enjoy the route :)
