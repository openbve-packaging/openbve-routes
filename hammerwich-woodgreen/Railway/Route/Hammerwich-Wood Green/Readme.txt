Note:
=====

*The route makes use of individual passing sounds for HST, class 47 & 87 by Anthony Bowden,
They are *not* included in this download, so you need Anthony's routes
installed. The Hammerwich route files will look for the Cross City & WJ-MKC sound folder in order
to obtain the sound sources. 

The Cross-City & WJ-MKC routes aren't required for Hammerwich to function, but you 
just won't hear some of the "enhanced" passing train sounds.
