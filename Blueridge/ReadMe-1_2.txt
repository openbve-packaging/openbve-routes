Notes:
           1.The F40PH is the default train.Increase power slowly to avoid wheel
               slippage,especially on the 20 slope.It's available from my site.
           2.I have no knowledge of railroad operations so please excuse me if my
               signals and their locations are strange.
------------------------------
Installing:Unzip anywhere;read the ReadMe;copy the "Object","Route" and "Sound" folders in your
BVE main folder (usually "c:\Program files\Bve" for BVE 2 and "C:\Program files\mackoy\Bve4"
for BVE 4).

I hope you enjoy driving it as much as I enjoyed making it.
