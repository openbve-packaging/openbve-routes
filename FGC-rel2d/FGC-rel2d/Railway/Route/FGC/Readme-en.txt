Version 2D - July 2009
designed for BVE 2, but working also with BVE 4 and OpenBVE (tested with
version 1.2.0.0 beta.

Initial stretch from Genova to Campi (9.5 km long).

About 15 years ago, when I visited this beautiful metric gauge Italian railway,
I had been specially impressed by a particular familiar feeling, as it was not
possible to find in any other railway company. It's about one year since Sergio
Usai, technician working for the FGC company, proposed me to collaborate at the
construction of the line for the BVE simulator. I'm glad that now, after the
beta version of some months ago, the first 5 km of the line, from Genova to
Cappuccio can be released in their final version.

My invitation is to visit first FGC by Sergio Usai Internet site
http://fgc.altervista.org/ and the Ferrovia Genova-Casella official site
http://www.ferroviagenovacasella.it/, where you can find information and
pictures about the real railway and I also encourage you to visit the real line!
A trip on its fabulous little trains worth a travel from far away and it will
be pleasantly remembered for remainder in your life!
This year the Genova-Casella railways celebrates 75 years from its opening and
you can find the rich manifestations and special trains program on the official
site.

Coming back to BVE, the construction of this first stretch has been made as real
as possible (as allowed by limitations of the program) and more than 200
textures has been built, most of them taken from Sergio Usai's photos.
Furthermore Sergio has already provided four of the railcars running on the line
and the historical L29 locomotive: they can be downloaded from his site.

I am sorry because the weight of some objects is not much suitable to old
computers, but the release 2 of FGC line has been built to be enjoyable also
with the future version of BVE in high resolution.
A big thank, other then Sergio Usai, to these persons to have furnished photos
and textures and precious suggestions after having tested my initial work:
- Alfred Barten
- John Gongalves
- Michael Goetz 
- Mauro Vincenzo Loiacono

The stretch of the line (wholly 24 km long) available is the first stretch 9.5 km
long from Genova to Cappuccio with S.Pantaleo, S.Antonino, Cappuccio and Trensasco
intermediate stop stations.

The BVE route faithfully reproduces the 1,000 mm gauge line's layout, radii in
curves and real slope. Some typical places and rolling stock are reproduced with
specific objects using photographic textures, while most of scenery (like
threes and bushes) is fictional. Some people are trainmen really working at FGC!
Maximum speed allowed is generally 30 km/h with these exceptions:
- divergent points: 20 Km/h
- convergent points: 25 Km/h
- Poggino straight stretch: 35 Km/h
Other speed restrictions along the line are announced using properly
signals.
