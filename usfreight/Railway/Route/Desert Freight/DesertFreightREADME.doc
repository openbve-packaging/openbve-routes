\ul\fs24 The Route:\fs20\par
\par
\ulnone You'll take charge of one of the beasts of US railroad operations either the GP38 Diesel or GS4 Steam loco, pulling heavy wagons, passengers or mail through some spectacular desert scenery. \par
\par
\cf1 Although passenger trains are allowed full linespeed, please note that freight operations are limited to \ul 55mph\ulnone . When you see how long it takes to stop the train you'll understand why!\cf0\ul\par
\par
\ulnone The route begins its 24.5 mile (55km) journey at the iron ore hills of \i Mount Causeway\i0 . The station at Mount Causeway still operates passenger trains, but the small yard here, serves it's most frequent customer: the MLFC (Mile Long Freight Company).\par
\par
From the delivery sidings or platform your train roars out of the yard onto the double track Trans-Desert route. \par
\par
The line, here falls quite rapidly (a 28 downhill grade in part). Linespeed increases for a while, but you'll struggle to slow your train down for the falling gradient. The lines converge - then a single track \par
viaduct takes you over the murky \i River Campbell\i0 . \par
\par
Then follows an uphill 30 gradient which soon becomes a rapid decent down \i Checketts Bank \i0 (named after Harry Checketts - the founder of the iron ore plant at the base of the incline). The line runs single track on a rocky ledge, through some tunnels and down towards the Checketts Bank  stop. This is a tricky little run. The gradient changes from -31 to -15 and -10 but there is a 15mph turnout at the foot of the mountain, protected by a red signal. \cf1\i You'll have to brake early and harsh in order to approach the signal a speed slow enough to stop at it!\par
\cf0\par
\i0 After crossing back from the platform loop onto the main running line the gradient levels out, before starting to climb. Here you will travel through the sandstone rock cuttings for the duration. The line singles out again for the long viaduct at \i Thingley\i0  before falling and rising again over highway Route 56 and  up the \i Oldnall spine ridge\i0 . Careful at the summit - tracks double once again and trains are usually diverted onto the 15mph right \par
hand road.\par
\par
The lines here run along the side of \i Mount Lloyd\i0 . The line was doubled here in 1949 and your track is built on a cantilevered platform on the edge of the existing ledge. Lets hope you don't fail your train here. It's a long way down if you're scared of heights!\par
\par
Soon the linespeed drops to 35mph as a sweeping right hand curve falls through a falling gradient of 20.\i  Time to test out those brakes again!\par
\par
\i0 As the line levels out you'll hit the lines from North Hesson, for a short fast four track run contained within a deep gorge. The lines shortly converge into a single track for a sharp curve leading to the yard at \i Brownhills\i0 . There can be a signal check here as passenger services to the South turn around at the station. \cf1\i The actual platforms lie on an uphill 20 gradient. It will take some judgement to stop the train in the right place!\i0\par
\par
\cf2 After the struggle to leave Brownhills the lines climb further up the Western ridge of the mountain, settling back to single track and passing through several tunnels and then reaching a plateau. The gradients here are much kinder. You'll pass through various shanty settlements including Claghorn and New Jackson through more tunnels and forward to the \i Stimpson Pass. \par
\par
\i0 The pass leads gently uphill, with some breaks in the rocky wall, giving you a glimpse of the surrounding cliffs, canyons and sandy plateaus. You're now heading for the freight depot at\i  Carlsberg,\i0  where your relief will be waiting on the platform. Its time for your break - a few glasses of ice cold soda and a chat with your conductor before some picking up a later working.\i\fs24\par

\ul Tips on driving & signalling\par
\par
\ulnone\par
\lang1033\fs20 American railroads are very distinctive in their operations. Faced with long distances and cut-throat completion, these railroads developed in their own special flavor. Longer trains, harder use, and flexible scheduling are only some of the enhancements US railroads experimented with between their occasional bouts of receivership.\par
\par
\tab The following are practices you might wish to incorporate while running the Desert Route scenarios...\par
\par
\tab SIGNALS: Signals in BVE reflect a block-occupancy control system. Generally, the signal immediately behind the train is red, the next one out, yellow. This being the case, a yellow signal is not necessarily a \ldblquote reduced speed\rdblquote  signal, but rather a sign to the engineer that he must be able to stop before encountering the signal following.\par
\par
\tab This means that an engineer who is running late and knows a division well can make up time by holding his speed up while passing a yellow. As long as he knows the location of the next signal and can stop at it, he can proceed at posted speeds. For those on the Desert Route, this is particularly important in some of the longer blocks you might encounter. For example, there is a very long 70mph block following Claghorn. If you know where the next signal is, you can pretty much run this block at full speed, gaining back valuable time. Of course, remember that you are gambling with your career. If you run a red signal, you will be clearing out your locker before nightfall.\par
\par
\tab Please note that there are two signals that are controlled directly by the dispatcher. Signals 7966 and 7922 will occasionally be set to red, regardless of traffic. Engineers should approach such signals with caution and stop after the \ldblquote stop point\rdblquote  bar (just like a station) has been reached. The signal will be reset at the dispatcher\rquote s discretion.\par
\par
\tab BELLS & WHISTLE: The audible devices on your train are there to signal the crew and warn those nearby. There are a number of messages that you, the engineer, are required to make. Assume that \ldblquote o\rdblquote  is a short whistle (RETURN) and \ldblquote -\ldblquote  is a long whistle (SHIFT-RETURN). The bell is sounded with (CTRL-RETURN).\par
\par
- \tab When standing, air brakes applied\par
- - \tab Release brakes, proceed\par
ooo \tab When standing, back up.\par
- - o - \tab Approaching a grade crossing. Begin signal at \ldblquote W\rdblquote  (whistle) post.\par
- - o \tab Approaching meet or waiting locations.\par
BELL\tab Approach to any station platform or area where employees might be working.\par
\par
\tab BRAKE TESTS: It would be very bad to start down the slope out of Causeway and find that your brakes have failed. While rolling within yard limits, the engineer should briefly apply his brakes, and confirm a small drop in forward velocity. \par
