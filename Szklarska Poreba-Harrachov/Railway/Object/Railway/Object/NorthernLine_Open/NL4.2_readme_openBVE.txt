The releases covers the London Underground Ltd Northern Line's North Operations between Edgware and Kennington Loop (Southbound), and between Kennington Loop and High Barnet (Northbound) and Edgware via Bank to Morden*.

The 1998 era openBVE route files use the high resolution 1995 Stock. This train features working tripcocks, simulates traction loss over rail gaps, separate left and right door opening pilotlights.
There is now a fully animated external views and passenger view, including doors, body side lights, switchable head and tail lights, animated wheels, saloon lighting switch, animated destination indicator, front and rear door cut-outs. 

The HOME key will give temporary tripcock isolation
The SPACE key will reset a brake application caused by a tripcock after a short time delay.
The PageUp Key will switch on the wiper (toggle for intermittant wipe)
The PageDn key will switch off the wiper

Rear door cut outs are driven by track beacons and are automatic.

If you jump stations the tripcock may apply the brakes if you jump past red signals. To reset, place the controller to OFF and the reverser to NEUTRAL. Press SPACE. The brake should then release, and you can carry on as normal.

Signals:
========

You need to be aware of the following:

The Northern line signals are operated by "line of sight", i.e. some main aspects that are displayed are red and green (home or starter signals). You'll have to look out for the signal in the distance. If it's red you'll have time to stop (unless you're speeding of course). Occasionally on tight curves or signals with close headways you'll see a distant (repeater in LU language) which can be green or yellow giving prior warning of the state of the next signal. Sometimes the home and repeater are based on the same head where headways are close. In busy areas signals can be as close as 60m apart. Don't fall asleep!

Some of the routes are fitted with the London Underground Tripcock train stop system. This safety system will bring the train to a stand if you pass a signal at danger (SPAD) or drive above the linespeed in certain areas. 

If you do SPAD, then you'll have to reset the safety system on your train. Press the SPACE key. Put your brakes in the apply position, and then open up the power controller once more.

In openBVE it is possible to temporarily over-ride the tripcock device. Press HOME key. This will light up the Tripcock delay light on the panel. You may then pass the next signal at danger without penalty
